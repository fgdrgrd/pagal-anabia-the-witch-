    <h1>Pagal Anabia: The Witch</h1>
    <h3>A dark tale of magic, mystery, and the curse of the forgotten.</h3>

    <div class="story">
      <p>
        Deep within the silent forest, where moonlight barely touched the ground,
        lived a witch named <strong>Pagal Anabia</strong>. Her laughter echoed through
        the trees — not with joy, but with a secret that time itself feared.
      </p>

      <p>
        Villagers spoke of her eyes — glowing like dying embers — and her power to
        twist reality with a single whisper. Some said she was cursed, others believed
        she had made a deal with something far darker than the night.
      </p>

      <p>
        One stormy night, the wind carried screams from the forest. Anabia had begun
        her final ritual — one that would tear open the veil between worlds.
        Thunder cracked, and the earth trembled as shadows danced around her.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the lightning struck, the forest fell silent.  
        Pagal Anabia was gone — only her wand, burning with a cold blue flame, remained.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Her final words echoed in the darkness:<br>
        <span class="curse">“Gagar will come back...”</span>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        No one knows who — or what — Gagar is.  
        But every few decades, when the moon turns crimson, a strange wind blows through the
        same forest... and whispers her name again.
